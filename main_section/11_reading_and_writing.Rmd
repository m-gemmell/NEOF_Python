# Reading and writing files

Often we want to read from a data file, perform some task with the data, and write out
another file.

To read/write a file in Python we open a data stream using a statement such as:

(don't add this line to the script)
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open(path_to_file, "open_mode") as input_file:
```

There are two parts to consider:

  - open(path_to_file, mode)
  
  - with(...`<input-file>`...) as input_file:
  
## 'open'
<center>![](images/open.png){height=220px}</center>
The 'open' statement asks the Python interpreter to make a link to the specified file and open a data stream.
We need to specify the mode by which the file is opened.
The most common modes are:
 
 - 'w'   - WRITE: Open for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be replaced by a new, empty file.
 - 'r'   - READ: Open an existing file for reading.
 - 'a'   - APPEND: Open for reading and writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, new data will be added to the end of the existing file.
 
There are other modes but these three cover the majority of file tasks.

## 'with'

The `with` statement, which is wrapped around the `open()` statement, gives this data stream a variable name (input_file).
It also performs important 'under-the-hood' cleaning up that stops files from becoming corrupted.

## Read a data file

Open a new script in Gedit. Again add the location of our working directory and load the SeqIO library. 
Add the following to open a data stream to <b>read</b> the provided file 'patients_data.csv'.
Then add a `for` loop to print each line of the file.

Save the script as "script03.py" and run it from the terminal.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
wd = "/pub14/tea/nsc201"
from Bio import SeqIO

with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/patients_gut_data.csv", 'r') as input_file:
  for row in input_file:
    print(row)
```

The data from the file is printed in the terminal window (we will learn to organise this output in a more usable way in the supplementary material).

## Write data to a file
<center>![](images/write.png){height=220px}</center>

Modify the script above to add a second data stream, opening a second file for *write* access.
Again, we loop through the input_file however this time for each row in the file, we
prepend the line of data with the string "Study_2022,", and write this new data line to the output file
using the `.write()` method.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/patients_modified.csv", 'w') as output_file:
    with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/patients_gut_data.csv", 'r') as input_file:
        for row in input_file:
            #print(row)
            output_file.write("Study_2022," + row)
```

In the <b>terminal</b> window, run the following to view first few lines of the new "patients_modified.csv" file. You will
see that each row in the data now starts with the "Study_2022" string.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
# In the terminal (not the Python script)
cd ~
head Python_course_data/patients_modified.csv
```

## Write out the filtered Undulate ray sequence data
Returning to our example data relating to the undulate ray, we have a list of sequence records (trimmed_sequences) which have passed our filters and we now want to write out the FASTQ file so that it might be further analysed using another piece of software.

<b>Return to the script in Gedit that was concerned with the FastQ data (named script02.py).</b>

At the bottom of the script, we will open up a data stream to a new output file, and then used SeqIO's built in write method to write out data, specifying that we want a FASTQ format file:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open(wd + "/Python_course_data/R_undulata_filtered_seqs.fastq", 'w') as output_file:
  SeqIO.write(trimmed_sequences, output_file, "fastq")
```  

This trimmed, filtered file would now be ready to go into whichever subsequent analysis was desired.

## Recap

<center>![](../images/recap.webp){height=300px}</center>
To read or write files we need to open a data stream using the <b>with</b> and <b>open</b> functions. 

Each file can be opened in one of several modes; either <b>w</b>rite, <b>r</b>ead, or <b>a</b>ppend, depending on what you need to do. 

Once files are written to the disk they are available to use in further analyses or other pieces of software.
