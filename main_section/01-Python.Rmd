# Introduction

<center>![](figures/python.png){width=30%}</center>

In this practical session we are going to learn Python programming skills. We will be learning the fundamentals of Python scripting and several Python tools focused on data manipulation. Whilst we will be working mostly with DNA sequence data, the methods and approaches can be modified to work with most types of data.

During this session we will work through the following sections:

- [Course Introduction][Python for bioinformatics]
- [Working in the VNC][Cluster Introduction]
- [Scripting in Python][Scripting in Python]
- [Python Fundamentals][Python Fundamentals]
- [Data Structures][Data Structures]
- [Conditions (if and else statements)][Python Conditions: 'if' and 'else' statements]
- [Loops][Loops]
- [Working with DNA Sequence Data][Reading sequence data]
- [Manipulating Sequence Data][Using Conditions to Modify DNA Data]
- [Reading and Writing Files][Reading and writing files]
