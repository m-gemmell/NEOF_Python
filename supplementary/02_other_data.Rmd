Often scientists store data in delimited text files. These are typically
separated by commas or tabs. We can **read** these into Python, **loop**
through them and manipulate their values. We will do this using
similar/identical approaches that we used with our sequence data
previously.

We are going to load a new example dataset; a table of comma delimited
data. We will then use the Python module
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to filter and manipulate the data.

Create a new notebook called **"10-Pandas"** for this chapter.

## Background info on the example data
<center>
![](figures/microbiome_icon.webp){style="width:200px; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

The example data we are working with is a subset of the
[Atlas1006](https://rdrr.io/github/microbiome/microbiome/man/atlas1006.html)
dataset, which itself is example data provided with the R package
[microbiome](https://microbiome.github.io/tutorials/).

It contains information on 1006 western women with no reported health
complications. The women had their gut microbiome profiled and several
other characteristics recorded.

The data we will be looking at contains the following variables:

-   SampleID
-   Age
-   Gender
-   Nationality
-   Diverity of gut microbiome
-   A BMI category

## Read a .csv file with pandas
<center>
![](figures/pandas_icon.jpg){style="width:200px"}

The Python **library** [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is
specifically designed for reading delimited text files. It pre-processes
text data files and makes them easier to process and use in analysis.

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) allows us to access certain
elements within each row. For example, the gender of each patient.

With [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) let us **read** in the file
**"patients_gut_data.csv"**.

First we need to load the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
**module**.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#load pandas
import pandas
```

Next we will **read** in the data with the
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) **function** `read_csv()`.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Read in csv file
patients = pandas.read_csv("patients_gut_data.csv")
```

We have read in a __[DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)__.
Look at the top of this __DataFrame__ with the `.head()` __method__.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
patients.head()
```

One very useful feature of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is that
the **object** created when **reading** in the file will not dissappear
when it is used. This means you can **read** in the file once and do
many tasks with the resulting **object**.

Next, we can take a look at how [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) has stored the data by looking at the **".dtypes"** (data types).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print(patients.dtypes)
```

Pandas has automatically used the column headers as the variable names,
and assigned each variable a type based on the data:

-   **int64**: An integer.
-   **float64**: A floating point number.
-   **object**: A catch all term for string types

We can access a single column of data by it's variable name assigned by
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). For example, to access the
'diversity' column:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print(patients.diversity)
```

To access individual records, we need to first tell
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) which column contains the index, or
sample names.

We can set the **index** column when **reading** in the file with the
option `index_col`. In the case of the **"patients_gut_data.csv"** data
file, the identifiers are in the first column, which Python counts as
column zero.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Read in file and use 1st column as index
patients = pandas.read_csv("patients_gut_data.csv", index_col=0)
#Print nationality information for Sample-21
print(patients.nationality["Sample-21"])
```

## Make more complex selections
<center>

</center>

Pandas is very powerful for selecting columns and records from the data
by any conditions we want.

### Select columns by name

Let's select the data relating to the age, gut microbiome diversity, and
bmi_group and save it as a separate variable.

<b>*NOTE* the double square brackets containing the variable names: [[
]]</b>. This is used because:

-   We are choosing columns from the **patients data frame** by indexing, carried out
    by the outer square brackets (<b>[</b>[]<b>]</b>).
-    We're using a **list** of the column names to select columns to
    index. This is carried out by the inner square brackets ([<b>[]</b>]).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Subset patients info
age_div_bmi = patients[["age", "diversity", "bmi_group"]]
#Print
print(age_div_bmi)
print(type(age_div_bmi))
```

The below code carries out the same task but demonstrates the usage of the inner square brackets.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#List of column names to extract
column_names = ["age", "diversity", "bmi_group"]
#Subset patients info
age_div_bmi = patients[column_names]
#Print
print(age_div_bmi)
print(type(age_div_bmi))
```

We can see our new dataframe contains just the columns we selected.
By checking it with the `type()` function, we know this new dataframe is in the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) format.

### Select records by their properties
<center>
![](figures/venn_icon.jpg){style="width:200px; border-radius:5px"}
</center>

Let's choose records which fit certain criteria.

First we'll choose records from the patients data in which the patient
is aged 25 years or more __AND__ are overweight. The two statements are
linked together by the __AND__ operator (`&`).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Select 25 or older and overweight
overweight_over25 = patients[(patients["age"] >= 25) & (patients["bmi_group"] == "overweight")]
#print
print(overweight_over25)
```

We can also do something similar but using the *OR* operator (`|`).

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Select entries who are overweight or severeobese
obese_or_severeobese = patients[(patients["bmi_group"] == "obese") | (patients["bmi_group"] == "severeobese")]
#print
print(obese_or_severeobese)
```

## Applying functions and methods to pandas objects

</center>

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) provides useful methods for working
with data tables, as we have seen. All of the previous approaches that
we used in the main book still apply to data which has been
processed using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

For example, we can use pandas to select the age column, and convert the
number of years to months:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print(patients.age*12)
```

We can also pass pandas data to functions, as before.

Or, we could define a new function and use that with pandas data.

The below code calculates the average diversity.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
#Set variable for total diversity
div_total = 0
#Loop through diversity values in patients
for div in patients.diversity:
  #Add value to div_total
  div_total = div_total + div
#Print average diversity
print(div_total / len(patients.diversity))
```
